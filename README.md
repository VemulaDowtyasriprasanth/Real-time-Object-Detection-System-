# Real-time-Object-Detection-System-
 Developed a real-time object detection system using TensorFlow and OpenCV, allowing for the identification of objects within live video streams. The system utilizes a pre-trained object detection model from TensorFlow's Model Zoo and processes frames in real-time, drawing bounding boxes around detected objects and displaying results on the screen.
